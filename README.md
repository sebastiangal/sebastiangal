ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, Iâ€™m SebastiÃ¡n Galindo (@sebastiangal) a guatemalan Computer Science Engineer currently working in the telecomms field as a Software Specialist
where I do software development and data analysis processes to get a competitive advantage in the market.

ðŸ‘€ I'm venturing myself into the game dev world because it has always been my dream job to live off of making videogames and making great gaming experiences for 
every possible gamer and currently non-gamers out there. This github repository will hopefully give you a glimpse of my work and personal projects I'm making on my own.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Masters Degree in Applied Data Science and hopefully I can someday get the opportunity and mix both of these worlds (game-dev and data science) 
into one beautiful experience.

ðŸ“« I you want to get in contact with me you can get in touch with me at sebastian28.gc@gmail.com and ocassionally you can find me at https://twitch.tv/kingsrox where I do some
variety games streams. 

As always GGWP and GLHF.
